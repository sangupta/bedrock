Components are the basic building blocks of the UI. If you are
familiar with [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/),
Bedrock components include both `atoms` and `molecules`.

Components are categorized into the following sub-categories:

* Buttons - different kinds of buttons
* Cards
* Connectors - connectors to 3rd party UI tools like FontAwesome, Gravatar etc.
* Containers
* Content
* Form - to display various form elements
* Groups - to display multiple instances of same components as a single unit
* Layout
* Nav
* Notify - to display various notifications like alerts, toasts etc.
* Popovers - anything that overlays other UI, like context-menu, dropdowns, modals etc
* Progress - to display progress of an action, like progress bar, spinner, loading dots etc
* Tables - to display tabular data
