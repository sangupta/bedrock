`Bedrock` is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) component library built 
entirely in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the UI styles. 

It has no **external** dependencies.

## Categories

Bedrock components are divided into the following categories:

* [Components](/#/Components) : all reusable UI components
* [Fragments](/#/Fragments) : combination of commonly used component patterns - like a Login Box
* [Primed](/#/Primed) : components that are primed with common data-sources, like a Country-selector dropdown
* [Templates](/#/Templates) : commonly used full-page templates

## Usage

Using `Bedrock` involves the following 3 steps:

* Include Bootstrap CSS in your `index.html`
* Define `bedrock` as a dependency in your `package.json`
* Use bedrock components, as simply as, `import { Button } from 'bedrock';`
